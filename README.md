# Caesar Cipher GUI
## Description
- This is a Caesar Cipher program with a nice GUI that me and my group mate Sokkhandara made for our cyber security class project. I left off all class information so that nobody scalps the professor's assignment exactly.
- Our project is tiered, user view and admin view. We emulated the lite vs premium user theme found in a lot of mobile/other applications, where lite users have less access to functionality than premium users.
- Some noteworthy functionality of this application includes things like hashed username/password for safe storing and percent likelihood of the decrypted string being the string that was encrypted (using recursive binary search tree sorting algorithm when looking through dictionary for speed).

## Install
1. Download the files to some folder and unzip the files
2. install the latest JDK (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads)
3. associate the .jar file in the files folder with (javaw.exe) (Windows 10/11 right click on the .jar file -> click "open with" -> click "choose another app" -> scroll to bottom of list and press "choose an app on your PC" -> navigate to [C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-{version#}\bin] and choose javaw.exe [java.exe is reccomended online, but I've found javaw.exe is the one that works for me])
4. run the .jar file

## Note
- Sokhanndara's code is with the comments that are more spaced out, mine (Kris's) are with the comments that are more close together with the code.
- The username/password is: CoolKid99/something
- We used documents relavent to the founding of the United States as test files! :) God bless the U S A! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
- Code can be found in the "src" folder, the file structure of this repository is a mirror image of the file structure used for the IDE intelliJ. 
- I (Kris) designed the GUI and consulted Sokhanndara.
